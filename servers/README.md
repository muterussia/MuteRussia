This folder contains lists of pages located on the target servers. We have picked them from the WebArchive.org, filtered and sorted by the page size in bytes descending to maximize the effect of the script as it is expected that larger pages will consume more resources on the server (especially for complex pages wit many DB requests). You can freely use these lists for your project with the similar purpose.
